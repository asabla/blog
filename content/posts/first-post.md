This is my first post on this blog using Hugo and Github pages. I will use this blog/whatever it is for learning
<!--more-->

### Purpose of this blog thingy
This small site will be my main place to write about things I learn within my profession or any hobbies which may find their way out on the interwebs. Part of the process of posting here will be to document things I learn about programming, hosting or any IT-stuff in general basically.

My goal is to write at least one post a month with a specific topic in mind, be it either about programming or movies

That's it!
