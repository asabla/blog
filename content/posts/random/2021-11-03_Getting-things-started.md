So it finally happened. Everything seems to be in place, workflows no longer throws errors and cache is being purged upon publish.

### Main goals and what is this for?

For the last couple of years I've been finding my self more and more in situations were I'm quite sure I've solved a problem before. However I never seem to able to find any notes or even related code to it. So in order to fix this for my self I thought a small blog about my adventures within IT and related subjects should be sufficient.

I do not aim for this to become popular or easy to read for others. My primary goal will always be documenting things I've found a solution for, or documentation on steps to achieve something (like deploying a certain type of software upon a VPS).

This post will also act as a way to display supported capability for my current setup (see examples below), such as headers, tables and such. In the future I will put together a post about how everything has been put together and how I would set this up again for other projects or similar sites.

Basically all the components are:

* Hugo, for static file generation and simplify themes and styles
* Github pages for hosting
* Cloudflare for cache an delivery optimization

Once I find my self in a more motivated state, there will be a post about it. However rest of this post will be a showcase of what Hugo (with current theme) is capable of displaying. All of this has been copied from [Binario - Basic elements post](https://binario.netlify.app/post/basic-elements/).

Enjoy!

## Headings

Let's start with all possible headings. The HTML `<h1>`—`<h6>` elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level and `<h6>` is the lowest.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

***

## Paragraph

According to the [HTML5 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#elements) by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/), **HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text**. Each element is denoted in the source by a [start tag](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-start-tags), such as `<body>`, and an [end tag](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-end-tags), such as `</body>`. (*Certain start tags and end tags can in certain cases be omitted and are implied by other tags.*)

Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. For example, hyperlink are formed using the `a` element and its `href` attribute.

## List Types

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List

* List item
* Another item
* And another item

### Nested list

<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item
    <ul>
      <li>Second item First subitem</li>
      <li>Second item second subitem
        <ul>
          <li>Second item Second subitem First sub-subitem</li>
          <li>Second item Second subitem Second sub-subitem</li>
          <li>Second item Second subitem Third sub-subitem</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Second item Third subitem
        <ol>
          <li>Second item Third subitem First sub-subitem</li>
          <li>Second item Third subitem Second sub-subitem</li>
          <li>Second item Third subitem Third sub-subitem</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>

### Definition List

HTML also supports definition lists.

<dl>
  <dt>Blanco tequila</dt>
  <dd>The purest form of the blue agave spirit...</dd>
  <dt>Reposado tequila</dt>
  <dd>Typically aged in wooden barrels for between two and eleven months...</dd>
</dl>

## Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a `footer` or `cite` element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.

> Quoted text.
> This line is part of the same quote.
> Also you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Blockquote with a citation.

<blockquote>
  <p>My goal wasn't to make a ton of money. It was to build good computers. I only started the company when I realized I could be an engineer forever.</p>
  <footer>— <cite>Steve Wozniak</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

According to Mozilla's website, <q cite="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/history/details/">Firefox 1.0 was released in 2004 and became a big success.</q>

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but Hugo supports them.

| ID  | Make      | Model   | Year |
| --- | --------- | ------- | ---- |
| 1   | Honda     | Accord  | 2009 |
| 2   | Toyota    | Camry   | 2012 |
| 3   | Hyundai   | Elantra | 2010 |

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables      | Are           | Cool         |
|:----------- |:-------------:| ------------:|
| align: left | align: center | align: right |
| align: left | align: center | align: right |
| align: left | align: center | align: right |

You can also use inline Markdown.

| Inline     | Markdown  | In                | Table      |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| *italics*  | **bold**  | ~~strikethrough~~ | `code`     |

## Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Example HTML5 Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Test</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Highlighted Code

{{< highlight html >}}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Example HTML5 Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Test</p>
</body>
</html>
{{< /highlight >}}
